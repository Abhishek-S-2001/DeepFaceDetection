        Autoencoders and GAN, which are based on deep learning, have lately grown in prominence in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) because to their capacity to synthesise the picture.<br /> 
        Additionally, more recent modifications, including BigGAN and Progressive Growth of GANs  have been utilised to create lifelike pictures that are challenging for humans to spot it fake.<br />
        Generally, generative programmes translate images, which might result in major issues if a fraudulent picture is misused on social networking platforms. <br />
        Additionally, the GANs are capable of producing a speech video with well-known politician's mock face material. It poses serious issues for social, political, and economic activities.<br />
        Therefore, the necessity of an authentic false face picture identification method is important. <br />
        Our objective is to create false picture detection software that accurately identifies these phoney photos,<br />
         is user-friendly, and alerts users to the tell-tale indicators of fake images.
